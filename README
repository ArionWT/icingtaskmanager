Icing Task Manager
=============

This is a fork of the unfinished development branch of Window List With App Grouping applet, originally by jake-phy who forked the code from GNOME Shell Window List. This applet is the only reason I continue to use Cinnamon, and after seeing the development branch quietly having many more features and being unreleased for months, I decided to try to continue the work with a hard fork.

Changes in this repo

  * Ability to move windows between monitors is now fixed
  * More theme-agnostic close button than the one found on the development branch.
  * Shamelessly opinionated formatting of code.
