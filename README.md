Icing Task Manager
=============

This is a fork of the unfinished development branch of [Window List With App Grouping](https://github.com/jake-phy/WindowIconList/) applet, originally by jake-phy who forked the code from [GNOME Shell Window List](https://github.com/siefkenj/gnome-shell-windowlist/). This applet is one of the reasons I continue to use Cinnamon, and after seeing the development branch quietly having many more features and being unreleased for months, I decided to try to continue the work with a hard fork.

### Changes from the original version

  * Ability to move windows between monitors is now fixed.
  * More theme-agnostic close button than the one found on the development branch.
  * Integrated a [pull request](https://github.com/jake-phy/WindowIconList/pull/155) by mswiszcz, added optional icon size control.
  * Formatting of code for readability.
